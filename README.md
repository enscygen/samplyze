* **Role-Based Access Control**: A flexible permission system allows administrators to create custom roles and assign specific permissions for each module.
* **Print-Friendly Reports & Cards**: Generate clean, print-ready reports and ID cards for applicants, samples, and visitors using the browser's native print functionality.
* **Production-Ready Deployment**: Uses the **Waitress WSGI server** for stable and reliable performance.

* **Data Management**:

  * Create full-system backups
  * Restore from a backup file
